Unit Test Cheat-Sheet
Frankly, the unit testing library for Python is fairly well documented, but it can be a bit of a dry read. Instead, we suggest covering the core module concepts, and then reading in more detail later.

Best of Unit Testing Standard Library Module
Understand a Basic Example:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#basic-example

Understand how to run the tests using the Command Line:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#command-line-interface

Understand various Unit Test Design Patterns:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#organizing-test-code

Understand the uses of setUp, tearDown; setUpModule and tearDownModule

Understand basic assertions:

Method

Checks that

New in

assertEqual(a, b)

a == b

assertNotEqual(a, b)

a != b

assertTrue(x)

bool(x) is True

assertFalse(x)

bool(x) is False

assertIs(a, b)

a is b

3.1

assertIsNot(a, b)

a is not b

3.1

assertIsNone(x)

x is None

3.1

assertIsNotNone(x)

x is not None

3.1

assertIn(a, b)

a in b

3.1

assertNotIn(a, b)

a not in b

3.1

assertIsInstance(a, b)

isinstance(a, b)

3.2

assertNotIsInstance(a, b)

not isinstance(a, b)

3.2

Understand more specific assertions such as assertRaises
